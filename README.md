# Objective
Solve the modified version of the global pairwise alignment scoring problem where the algorithm accounts for nucleotide insertions and deletions caused by DNA polymerase slippage.


# Responsibilities
Responsible for implementing an algorithm that runs in O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the sequences being compared. Modified the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for this objective.
